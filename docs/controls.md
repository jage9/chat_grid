# Controls Reference

This document is the authoritative keymap for the client.

## Touch Controls

- Touch controls appear automatically on coarse-pointer devices and can be shown or hidden from Settings.
- Tap a direction for one movement step; press and hold to continue moving.
- The directional buttons remain Up, Down, Left, and Right; menu screens may use those same directions for navigation.
- `Use` performs the current primary action; in menus it becomes `Select`.
- `Back` cancels or exits the current menu.
- `Chat` opens a native mobile text field and `Commands` opens a visual popup list of available commands.
- `Mute` and `Unmute` show and change the current microphone state.
- The control dock can be collapsed without covering the grid.

## Normal Mode

### Movement
- `Arrow Keys`: Move
- `Shift+K`, `Applications`, or `Shift+F10`: Open the command palette in supported modes
- `?`: Open help viewer
- `C`: Speak coordinates and any walls bordering the current square
- `Escape`: Press once for disconnect prompt, press again to disconnect

### Users, Nickname, Chat
- `L`: Locate nearest user
- `Shift+L`: List users alphabetically with current presence; `Enter` teleports to selected user; `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` adjust selected user volume
- `U`: Speak connected users
- `N`: Edit nickname
- `/`: Start chat
- In chat, commands are supported when `/` is the first character:
  - `/me <action>`: Send action text without `name:`
  - `/up`: Show server uptime (self only)
  - `/version`: Show server version (self only)
- `Shift+Z`: Admin menu (when role permissions allow)
- `,` / `.`: Previous/next message
- `<` / `>`: First/last message

### Items
- `I`: Locate nearest item
- `Shift+I`: List items and teleport to selected item with `Enter`
- `A`: Add item
- `O`: Edit item properties
- `Shift+O`: Inspect all item properties
- `D`: Pick up/drop item
- `Z`: Item management menu (delete/transfer when permitted)
- `Space` in item management menu: Read tooltip/help for the selected action
- `Enter`: Use item
- `Shift+Enter`: Secondary item action
- For an elevator, `Enter` calls or starts opening it, enters or exits only after the door is fully open, and has no boarding effect while the door is opening or closing.

### World Builder

- `W`: Open World Builder when the account has `world.structure.edit`.
- `Add wall`: Select a server-configured type, then select the north, south, east, or west edge of the current square. Successful creation opens the new wall directly in the shared wall editor.
- `Edit walls`: List current-floor walls nearest first, then change type, orientation, occupied edge anchors, slide, detailed properties, or delete the complete wall.
- `Set start edge` / `Set end edge`: Each entry shows its current `x, y, z` unit-edge anchor. Start and end are inclusive, so a one-square wall reports the same coordinate for both. `ArrowLeft` decreases that anchor's run-axis coordinate by one; `ArrowRight` increases it. The result announces only the authoritative new coordinate.
- `Slide vertically` / `Slide horizontally`: `ArrowLeft` or `ArrowRight` moves a horizontal run along y or a vertical run along x without changing its length.
- `Orientation`: `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` cycles horizontal and vertical directly; `Enter` opens the shared option selector. Rotation keeps the start coordinate fixed and is rejected if the rotated run is outside the world or overlaps another wall.
- `Type`: This is the first wall action. `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` cycles presets directly; `Enter` opens the shared option selector. Choosing a preset resets title, movement behavior, height, transmission, low-pass, and contact sound to that preset's defaults.
- `Edit properties`: Change sound transmission (`0..1`), occlusion low-pass (`20..20000` hertz), or the contact-sound URL.
- On transmission or low-pass, `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` changes one numeric step and `PageDown`/`PageUp` changes ten steps. Inside the numeric editor, use `ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp` and the corresponding page keys.
- `Space`: Read specific help for the selected World Builder action, preset, direction, or wall. Property help uses shared metadata to report its type, options or numeric range, and editability.
- Walls are edited live. Other connected clients receive and render changes immediately.
- Wall deletion uses the same default-No confirmation flow as item deletion; confirmation choices do not have tooltips.
- Brick, glass, and fence walls block movement. Curtains may be crossed; wall impacts and curtain crossings play the structure's contact sound locally and spatially for nearby users.
- New curtain, glass, and fence walls use their matching contact sounds; brick uses the standard wall sound. Builders may edit any wall's sound URL.

### Audio
- `P`: Ping server
- `V`: Set microphone gain
- `Shift+V`: Microphone calibration
- `M`: Mute/unmute local microphone
- `Shift+M`: Toggle stereo/mono output
- `Shift+1` (`!`): Toggle loopback monitor
- `1`: Toggle voice layer
- `2`: Toggle item layer (emit sounds)
- `3`: Toggle media layer (radio)
- `4`: Toggle world layer (other-user world sounds)
- `E`: Effect select menu
